# learn opengl

This repo documents my journey through [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/)'s excellent OpenGL tutorials. I'm mostly coming from a place of curiosity as to how lower-level graphics APIs work, but I am interested in making some simple 2d and 3d games as well. We'll see how it goes.

## getting started

First up, I couldn't get anything to work well in the getting started section of learnopengl.com. I ended up getting glfw and glew working on macos via the following blog, which was exactly what I needed: http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/hellotriangle.html. I had to install the following to make it work:

```
brew install glfw glew
```

At this point I had a purple triangle on the screen, yay.
